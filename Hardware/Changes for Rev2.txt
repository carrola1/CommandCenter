Add white LED next to color sensor. TCS34725 breakout board I used on the space toy had an LED next to the sensor.
I thought it was integrated into the IC.

Make sure to use tantalum capacitor on boost regulator output!

Add some test points on SPI and I2C dummy.

The audio amps are not setup for stereo. They are both configured for left channel mono.
Not a big deal, but should go ahead and fix.

Switch to TXS0104EPWR for the level translator. The TXB0104PW I origially selected does not
like VCCA to be up before VCCB.

Extend the pads of the color sensor to make it easier to solder.

Consider replacing bar graphs with DotStars to save cost.

Consider adding an 8-segment display to count bar graph position.

Consider adding LC filters to audio outputs.

Need to change motor control output to a TIM controlled pin.

The TPS61030 datasheet suggests a 2.2uF ceramic in parallel with the large tantalum output cap for max output power.

The TPS61030 datasheet suggests a larger input capacitance (47uF) if input supply is located far away.

Improve layout of TPS61030.

Consider replacing TPS61030 with integrated solution (LTM4661).
